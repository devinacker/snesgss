### SNES GSS (Game Sound System) ###

The sole purpose of this software is to make music and sound effects for SNES homebrew games.

The system consists of an all-in-one editor (sample converter, tracker, resource manager) for Windows, SPC700 driver that is exported in binary form along with samples and music data, and 65816 C and assembly interface code to control it from a game.
